# supersonic
A lightweight desktop client for Subsonic music servers (Navidrome, Gonic, Airsonic, etc). This is in early development, but currently usable for searching, browsing, and playing by albums. If you decide to use it now, expect to find a few minor bugs and missing features.

On first startup, the app will prompt you for your Subsonic server connection. The app currently has a searchable albums grid view, an artist discography view, list views of all artists and genres, and individual album view with tracklist.

## Build instructions (Ubuntu)

### Install dependencies
* ``sudo snap install --classic go``
* ``sudo apt install libmpv-dev``
* ``sudo apt install gcc libegl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev``

### Build
* clone the repo, CD into the repo root, and run ``go build .``
* (note that the first build will take some time as it will download and build the UI library)

## Build instructions (Mac OS)

### Install dependencies
* install go
* install Xcode command-line tools (``xcode-select --install``)
* install libmpv (``brew install mpv``)

### Build
* Make sure header and library include paths include the dir in which homebrew installs headers/dylibs (may differ dep. on OS/Homebrew version)
  - ``export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH``
  - ``export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH``

* clone the repo, CD into the repo root, and run ``go build .``
* (note that the first build will take some time as it will download and build the UI library)

## Build instructions (Windows)

### Install dependencies
* install go (https://go.dev/doc/install)
* install MSYS2 and the required packages for the Fyne toolkit (follow instructions for Windows at https://developer.fyne.io/started/)
* install libmpv (in the MSYS2 terminal, ``pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-mpv``)

### Build
* in the MSYS2 terminal: clone the repo, CD into the repo root, and run ``go build .``
* (note that the first build will take some time as it will download and build the UI library)
* **Note**: The .exe dynamically links to MSYS2 libmpv dependency dlls and must be started from the MSYS2 terminal, or all dependency DLLS must be copied to the same folder as the .exe
* -> If you obtain a statically built mpv-2.dll (containing all its dependencies), and rename it to libmpv-2.dll, you can place just that DLL in the same directory as the EXE, and it should run
* Improvements to Windows build process will be forthcoming
